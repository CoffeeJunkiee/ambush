# Ambush

This software has been programmed to locate IPs where we are going to look them up according databases.
The library that has been used is python-geoip which provides access to GeoIP databases, here is the link if you want to look it up https://pythonhosted.org/python-geoip/

# Usage

To use Ambush is very simple you just have to open in terminal the program and type the IP first with ‘’  as the example shows.
Example: ‘192.168.0.1’

The reason why is that the database read the IP as a string and not as an integer.

# Requirements

To use Ambush you will need any OS, the only requirement is have installed Python and the library python-geoip, to see how to install the library, you should go to this link https://pythonhosted.org/python-geoip/.

# Updates
